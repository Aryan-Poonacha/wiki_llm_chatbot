Text: Due to how often the troupe moved from place to place, Masumi never developed friendships in school. In 1970, after the troupe's final show of the season in [[Isezaki Ijincho]], [[Yokohama]], Toshio planned to treat Masumi to Peking duck at a Chinese restaurant called [[Heian Tower]]. However, that night at the restaurant, Toshio was murdered by a hitman sent by the [[Seiryu Clan]]. <b>The incident had a profound effect on Masumi, who spent the next seven years searching for the killer.</b> With the troupe disbanded after Toshio's death, Masumi drifted to Kamurocho along with some fellow troupe members. He ended up joining the yakuza at the age of seventeen under the Hikawa Family, a [[Tojo Clan]] subsidiary. The Hikawa Family regularly killed people without hesitation, which Masumi took advantage of, disposing of the bodies in Ijincho's Homeless Quarter in order to spend as much time in Yokohama as possible and track down the culprit behind his father's murder, with no leads except for the memory of the killer's face., Score: 15.284937

However, in 1866, Sakamoto, Takechi's best friend who had spent the previous two years studying swordsmanship in Edo, returned to Tosa and joined the Kinno-to as well.</b> Due to their prior bond, Takechi appointed Sakamoto as his second-in-command on the day of his return. Several members of the party were opposed to this appointment, Okada among them. These dissatisfied party members confronted Sakamoto outside the Kinno-to's headquarters after a meeting and Okada challenged him to a duel., Score: 7.4371996

Text: However, Kaito realized they were lying in wait because he smelled Senda's cigarettes from outside the office door and called the police on them. When the cops arrived, Senda and his men were forced to jump out the office's second-story windows and then limp away to avoid being arrested. Soon after, Mikiko approached the Bato Agency in person and explained to them her plight: Her husband had murdered her parents and sister to gain access to their vast inheritance and, when she discovered this, he tried to have her killed. <b>He failed but she became amnesiac from her injuries and had spent the past few years in the care of [[Yasutaka Shirakaba]], the doctor who'd found her after her attack.</b> With his help, she faked her death and gradually recovered her memories, after which she started plotting to kill all those involved in her family's murder. Impressed by her tenacity and strength, the normally unscrupulous members of the Bato Agency decided to aid her in her mission, no matter the cost. To that effect, Senda started helping Mikiko keep tabs on [[Shusuke Kenmochi]], one of the Crimson Lotus' leaders, in the hopes of eventually catching him unguarded and killing him., Score: 7.2301793

However, Sudo had started his own investigation into the orders to arrest Kiryu and discovered Jingu's crimes, so he's decided to help Date in bringing down the MIA's director. Kiryu and Haruka reach Ares, where they are finally reunited with Yumi. <b>Yumi is overjoyed, both at being able to treat Haruka as her daughter and at seeing Kiryu for the first time in ten years.</b> However, the happy moment is interrupted when Jingu and a platoon of elite MIA operatives arrive by helicopter. The corrupt politician is determined to take back the 10 billion and kill Kiryu, Yumi and Haruka to protect his status. Jingu also reveals that he's made a deal with the Omi Alliance, where he would split the 10-billion with them so that they can take over the Tokyo underworld and, in exchange, control it to Jingu's advantage., Score: 6.779184

Kiryu goes to visit Koetsu together with Ittosai in order to find out about Sasaki's whereabouts, pointing him directly to that night's banquet for [[Itakura Katsuhige]].

By 2016, the Jingweon Mafia has returned to Japan and is making a new attempt to establish itself in the country, now led by a charismatic, young officer who'd also taken the identity of [[Joongi Han (Yakuza 6)|Joongi Han]]. Under Han's leadership, this new Japanese chapter of the Jingweon have stepped back from their fanatical adherence to the iron creed and are instead more preoccupied with turning into a successful criminal enterprise. <b>Regardless, some of the older members of the group still harbor resentment towards Kazuma Kiryu for his role in their humiliating defeat ten years prior.</b> The Jingweon manage to establish themselves in Tokyo once again by doing mercenary work for the CEO of Iwami Shipbuilding and son of [[Yomei Alliance]] Chairman [[Heizo Iwami]], [[Tsuneo Iwami]], who is plotting to overthrow his father and take over both Hiroshima and later Tokyo. Using the money they secured through their work for Tsuneo, they managed to buy several businesses across Kamurocho, including the famous host club, [[Stardust]], which they turned into a male striptease club. One of the jobs that the Jingweon carries out for Tsuneo is a hit on [[Big Lo]] and [[Jimmy Lo]], the leader and the heir of the [[Saio Triad]]; a Chinese criminal syndicate that Tseuno previously allied with but has now betrayed., Score: 6.6934786

The Four Kings are the highest ranked fighters in the Coliseum at [[The Castle]], the offshore adult entertainment district run by the [[Kijin Clan]]. <b>The Four Kings have spent years at the top of the Coliseum's hierarchy, having never been defeated in combat.</b> The de facto leader of the group is the number one ranked fighter in the arena, [[Kiyoshi Ugajin]], a lifelong competitor in underground fighting arenas who'd dominated several other such venues before settling in the Castle. Below him are [[JUSTICE1975]], a man who fights in mech armor, [[Kunimitsu Samejima]], a gun toting international hitman, and [[Dan Brody]], an American assassin and former circus clown/strongman. == Like a Dragon Gaiden: 2019 ==

'''Baba's fabricated past''': At the age of 20, Baba was a low-ranking member of the [[Kitakata Family]]. With the family at war against another family, Baba murdered someone in order for his [[aniki]] to become an officer, with the promise that he would pull strings in order to shorten Baba's release. Imprisoned, Baba waited a long time and assumed his aniki was busy in [[Kansai]]. <b>After ten years of waiting for him, Baba realized he had been simply used and tossed away.</b> == Involvement ==

Summary:
Masumi Arakawa spent seven years searching for the killer of his father, Toshio, who was murdered by a hitman sent by the Seiryu Clan. This incident deeply affected Masumi, leading him to join the yakuza and become devoted to his cause.[1] Additionally, a character in the story despises Ichiban Kasuga even after Kasuga spent 18 years in prison, showcasing a long-standing grudge despite the time served behind bars.[3]
